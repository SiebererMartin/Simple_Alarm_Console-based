# Simple_Alarm_Console-based
This little console program that plays an alarm sound when an entered time is elapsed.
If you call the alarm.py file without arguments, the user will be asked to provide minutes and seconds.
There is also the possibility to call the file with arguments, i.e.: alarm.py -t 10:00 - this will set the timer to 10 minutes.
If you want to change the sound, replace the alarm.mp3 file with you desired alarm. Note that it has to have the same name!
