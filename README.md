# Simple_Alarm_Console-based
This little console program, plays an alarm sound when an entered time is elapsed.
If you call the alarm.py file without arguments, you will be asked to provide minutes and seconds.
There is also the possibility to call the file with arguments, i.e.: alarm.py -t 10:00 - this will set the timer to 10 minutes.
